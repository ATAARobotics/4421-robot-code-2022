ROBOT INFORMATION
=================

Dimensions (without bumpers) are 0.8128 meters (32 inches) by 0.635 meters (25 inches)

Dimensions (with bumpers) are 0.9652 meters (38 inches) by 0.7874 meters (31 inches)

=================
FIELD INFORMATION
=================

All points on the field are given in meters x and y from the far left side of the driver station, x being along the driver station and y being
away from the driver station

When referenced in the code, the tarmac is divided into 4 quadrants. Each quadrant is numbered 1-4, 1 being the quadrant closest to the driver
station, and numbers increasing counterclockwise around the middle.

When referenced in the code, balls are numbered from 1-14. Balls 1-12 are around the tarmac, ball 1 being the farthest left ball on the driver
station side of the centerline, numbers increasing counterclockwise around the middle. Balls 13 and 14 are the two balls preset at the human player
station, 13 being the one at ours.

    Ball positions (if it isn't here, calculate it, and please avoid measuring):
        Ball 2: (2.0289, 4.9690)
        Ball 4: (6.3034, 5.0716)
        Ball 5: (7.9558, 7.5447)

================
AUTO INFORMATION
================

Robot should be exactly 0.4826 meters away from a wall to have a thin side pressed against it, and 0.3175 meters away to have a long side pressed against it

Robot should be slightly more than 0.4826 meters away from a ball to grab it with the intake

Positions to have the thin side pressed against a tarmac wall (again, if it isn't here, calculate it):
    Q1: (3.8017, 7.4141)
    Q2: (5.3694, 7.7480)
